        Slættaratindur, translated as “flat summit”, is the highest mountain in the Faroe Islands,
        towering at 880 metres. On a clear day, all 18 islands of the Faroe Islands can be viewed
        from the top (some claim that Iceland’s Vatnajökull mountain can also be seen!). On June
        21, the longest day of the year, it is tradition to climb Slættaratindur and watch the sun
        set and rise again.

        There are two points from which to start climbing to reach the summit; the first, from Gjógv,
        takes about four hours of hiking; the second, from Eiðisskarð, takes under an hour.

        As the country’s highest mountain, the mountain has an alluring effect on both old and young,
        Faroese and visitors. You start your trip at Eiðisskarð, which is the pass between Eiði and
        Funningur. Go over the fence at the parking lot where Eiðisskarð is highest. At this first
        leg, there is no path as such up to Slættaratindur, but when you go up, stay in a straight
        line from the parking lot. The fence is on your right-hand side. When you get to about 670
        metres’ altitude, or after about a 30-40 minutes’ walk, you will come to the path that leads
        to the top . The path is inclined uphill to the left. Here, you are already so high that
        you have a view of, e.g. Haldórsvík, with the eight-sided church and a string of mountains
        that encircle the villages in the north. Throughout the hike, you will be accompanied by sheep
        that graze at the top of the Faroe Islands.

        Follow the path one kilometre uphill. You then come to a point about 30 vertical metres from
        the top where the path turns a bend and goes to the right again . There are several trails of
        the path up here, but it is recommended that you ascend up on the back of the mountain where
        you turn the corner to the right. After a few metres, you are on the path again where you
        proceed uphill, keeping the top to your right. Be careful here, as it is gravelly and there
        may be loose stones. The last few metres up to the top are like a staircase made of rocks.
        Here, you also need to be careful because it is steep on your left-hand side. Feel that sense
        of butterflies in your stomach when you’ve reached the top. The view is nothing less than
        spectacular; especially, if you are lucky with the weather. On a clear, sunny day, the view
        covers practically all of the Faroe Islands. It is often said that if the weather is very
        clear and dry, you can see right across to Vatnajøkull in Iceland. The distance is 550
        kilometres. Experts are, however, in some doubt as to whether this is possible and point
        to the possibility of this being a mirage.

        There is a tradition in the Faroe Islands to climb Slættaratindur on 21 June, the longest day
        of the year. At the top of the mountain, people can experience the sunset and then, a few hours
        later, watch the sun rise again. Time spent waiting for the sun to rise is used for traditional
        chain dancing and singing, and packed lunches typically consist of skerpikjøt (wind-dried mutton),
        dried fish and whale meat, along with a strong cup of coffee to help with staying awake. Go down
        the same road as you walked up. Since it can be difficult to pinpoint where you came up on top,
        it can be a good idea to put a backpack, a colourful scarf or sweater by the “stairs” so you can
        find the spot to descent again. Be careful on the way down because the gravel can be slippery
        on a dry day, just as the rocks can be slippery in the wet.
