        In 2009 all guest rooms were refurbished. The design is harmonic with the nature and scenery outside every window. The hotel has chosen to use Montana and Philippe Starck design and welcomes you to the only design hotel in the Faroe Islands. The rooms are light with big windows. All double rooms are the same size and are equally equipped.
