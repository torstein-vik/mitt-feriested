        Barbara Fish House, located in a cute house cut into the rocks, has a fantastic tasting menu,
        consisting of locally-caught Faroese seafood such as horse mussels and smoked salmon, fresh
        scallops and Bouillabaise poured from a teapot. If you want to try Faroese seafood, Barbara
        is the place to go.
