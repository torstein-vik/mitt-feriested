        Hike along the old village path to the beautiful village of gásadalur, which was one of the
        most isolated villages in the faroe islands until a few years ago.

        Gásadalur has been one of the most isolated villages in the Faroes. It is difficult to get
        to the village by sea and it was not until 2004 that the village was connected to the rest
        of the island by road when the tunnel was built. The people of Gásadalur used to walk this
        path when they had to go to the neighbouring villages to trade or for other errands. The
        helicopter service began in 1983.

        The first stretch of the path is steep and runs close to the edge of the mountain. Therefore,
        walk extremely carefully, but do not forget to enjoy the outstanding view over Sørvágsfjørður,
        Tindhólmur, Gáshólmur and Mykines. In 2014, two men managed to climb all fives peaks of
        Tindhólmur.

        There is no church in Gásadalur so the school is used for services. The cemetery is from 1873.
        Before then, people were burried in Bøur and so the coffin had to be carried over the mountain
        to Bøur from Gásadalur. The trip was very difficult and the only place that the bearers could
        rest was at the Líksteinurin (Corpse Stone), which you will come upon halfway through the
        route. Further on, you come to the spring Vígdá. There is a story that a baby in Gásadalur
        became seriously ill and had to be taken to the doctor in Bøur. On the way to Bøur, the baby’s
        condition worsened and it was about to die. According to the Lutheran faith, your soul does
        not gain salvation if you die unbaptised. Therefore, the priest, who was travelling with them,
        quickly blessed the spring and baptised the baby.
