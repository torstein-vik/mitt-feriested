        Kirkjubøargarður (Faroese for Yard of Kirkjubøur, also known as King's Farm) is one of the
        oldest still inhabited wooden houses of the world, if not the oldest. The farm itself has
        always been the largest in the Faroe Islands.

        The old farmhouse of Kirkjubøur dates back to the 11th century. It was the episcopal residence
        and seminary of the Diocese of the Faroe Islands, from about 1100. The legend says, that the
        wood for the block houses came as driftwood from Norway and was accurately bundled and
        numbered, just for being set up. Note, that there is no forest in the Faroes and wood is a
        very valuable material. Many such wood legends are thus to be found in Faroese history.

        The oldest part is a so-called roykstova (reek parlour, or smoke room). Perhaps it was moved
        one day, because it does not fit to its foundation. Another ancient room is the loftstovan
        (loft room). It is supposed that Bishop Erlendur wrote the "Sheep Letter" here in 1298. This
        is the earliest document of the Faroes we know today. It is the statute concerning sheep
        breeding on the Faroes. Today the room is the farm's library. The stórastovan (large room)
        is from a much later date, being built in 1772.

        Though the farmhouse is a museum, the 17th generation of the Patursson Family, which has
        occupied it since 1550, is still living here. Shortly after the Reformation in the Faroe
        Islands in 1538, all the real estate of the Catholic Church was seized by the King of Denmark.
        This was about half of the land in the Faroes, and since then called King's Land (kongsjørð).
        The largest piece of King's Land was the farm in Kirkjubøur due to the above-mentioned
        Episcopal residence. This land is today owned by the Faroese government, and the Paturssons
        are tenants from generation to generation. It is always the oldest son, who becomes King's
        Farmer, and in contrast to the privately owned land, the King's Land is never divided between
        the sons.

        The farm holds sheep, cattle and some horses. It is possible to get a coffee here and buy
        fresh mutton and beef directly from the farmer. In the winter season there is also hare
        hunting for the locals. Groups can rent the roykstovan for festivities and will be served
        original Faroese cuisine.

        Other famous buildings directly by the farmhouse are the Magnus Cathedral and the Saint Olav's
        Church, which also date back to the mediaeval period. All three together represent the Faroe
        Island's most interesting historical site.
